# DNA-Sequence-Simulation-and-Mutation-using-NumPy
This project uses NumPy to simulate DNA sequences. It generates a random DNA sequence, introduces random mutations at selected positions, counts nucleotide frequencies, and converts the sequence into a numeric format for analysis. This approach helps understand sequence variability and computational DNA representation.
